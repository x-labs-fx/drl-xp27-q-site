      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>1. What is DrL-Xp27-Q and how does it work?</h3>
        <p>
          DrL-Xp27-Q is an Expert Advisor (EA) for MT4 that uses deep‐reinforcement
          learning to trade EURUSD &amp; AUDUSD. It continuously analyzes price
          movements and volatility in real time to decide entry, exit, and
          position size—aiming to maximize risk‐adjusted returns with low drawdown.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>2. Do I need any coding or trading experience?</h3>
        <p>
          No coding is required. Simply download and install the EA, attach it to
          an EURUSD or AUDUSD chart, and enable “AutoTrading.” Basic familiarity
          with MT4 (opening charts, enabling automated trading) is all you need.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>3. How do I start my free 7-day trial?</h3>
        <p>
          Click the <em>Download Free 7-Day Trial</em> button on the
          <a href="/drl-xp27-q-site/">home page</a>. No payment or license key is
          required. Install the <code>DrL-Xp27-Q.ex4</code> file in MT4’s
          Experts folder, attach to a chart, and begin trading immediately.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>4. What happens after my 7-day trial ends?</h3>
        <p>
          After 7 days, if you wish to continue using DrL-Xp27-Q (on demo or live),
          you pay a one-time license fee. This unlocks full access—no subscription
          or recurring charges under $10 000 live equity.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>5. How does the “Pay Only If You Profit” model work?</h3>
        <p>
          Once your live account equity goes above $10 000, we keep 10 % of any
          <em>new</em> profits generated by DrL-Xp27-Q. If your equity remains
          under $10 000, there are no additional fees beyond the one-time $500.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>6. Can I run this EA on a live account straight away?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, but we strongly recommend testing on a demo account for a few
          weeks to confirm you’re comfortable with its behavior. After trial,
          you can run the same <code>.ex4</code> on a live EURUSD or AUDUSD
          account.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>7. What should I set “Equity Risk %” to?</h3>
        <p>
          The default is 2 %—meaning the EA will risk up to 2 % of your account
          equity on each new position. Lower numbers (e.g., 1 %) are more
          conservative; higher (e.g., 10 %) are more aggressive. Choose based on
          your risk tolerance.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>8. What kind of drawdown should I expect?</h3>
        <p>
          On our tests, the max drawdown has hovered around 10-15 %. The EA
          actively reduces position size when volatility spikes to limit account
          drops. Keep in mind all trading carries risk, and live results can
          differ from demo.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>9. Is technical/support help included?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. During your free trial and afterwards, you have <a href="mailto:x.labs.fx@gmail.com">email support</a>
          for setup or troubleshooting questions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>10. Does it require a VPS or can I run on my desktop?</h3>
        <p>
          You can run DrL-Xp27-Q on any machine with MT4 installed,
          though using a low-latency VPS can reduce slippage and
          ensure continuous 24/5 operation.
